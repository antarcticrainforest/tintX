TintX main tracking utility.

TintX offers a simple :class:``RunDirectory`` class that uses the ``xarray``
library to read datasets such as model output data or observational datasets.

The cell tracking as well as visualisation of cell tracks is realised through
instances of this :class:`RunDirectory` class.
